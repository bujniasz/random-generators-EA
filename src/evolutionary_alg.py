    Perform the evolutionary algorithm to optimize a given function.

    This function represents a classic evolutionary algorithm approach where a
    population of individuals evolves through reproduction and mutation processes
    to find an optimal or near-optimal solution to the optimization problem.

    Parameters:
        q (callable): Objective function to be minimized.
        p0 (list): Initial population, where each individual is a solution.
        u (int): Number of individuals in a population.
        p_big_jump (float): Probability of mutating far in the space.
        delta_big (int or float): Coeffcient of far mutation.
        delta_small (int or float): Coefficient of standard mutation.
        pc: Probability of crossover.
        t_max (int or float): Maximum number of generations (iterations).
        limit (int or float): Boundary limit for the solution.
